# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a smart contract on Hotel Management, a deploy script for that contract, and a complete environment that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm i
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network name
```
